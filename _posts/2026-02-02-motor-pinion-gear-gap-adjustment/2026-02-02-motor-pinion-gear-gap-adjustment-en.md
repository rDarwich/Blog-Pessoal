When meshing the motor pinion gear with the spur gear, improper spacing can cause various issues. This post introduces a simple method to adjust gear spacing using a sheet of A4 paper.

## Why Gear Spacing Matters

The following problems can occur when meshing the motor pinion gear with the spur gear:

- **Too tight**: Excessive friction can prevent smooth rotation.
- **Too loose**: Gear tooth wear, noise, and torque loss may occur.

Therefore, it is important to mesh the pinion gear and drive shaft with the proper spacing.

> The most accurate method is trial and error — continuously checking for noise, torque delivery, etc. However, since this can be time-consuming and physically demanding, we recommend trying the A4 paper method described below first.

## Adjusting Gear Gap Using A4 Paper

### 1. Prepare a piece of A4 paper.

### 2. Fold it in half so that it is two layers thick.

### 3. Mesh the pinion gear and spur gear together, then press firmly.

### 4. While pressing, insert the folded A4 paper between the two gears. When the paper barely passes through, fix the motor in place.

## Further Adjustment

Following this procedure should provide an adequate initial setting. If you notice power delivery issues or unusual noise during operation, make fine adjustments as needed.

> After adjusting the gear gap, always run the motor to verify that noise levels and torque delivery are acceptable.

## Conclusion

This post introduced how to adjust the gap between the motor pinion gear and the drive shaft spur gear using A4 paper. A gap where a double-folded A4 paper barely passes through is appropriate for the initial setup. Fine-tune further during actual operation to find the optimal state.
