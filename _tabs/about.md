I am a VES (Visual Effects Society) nominated software developer with 6+ years of experience working across multiple shows and box office movies pursuing my passion and interest for hacking and secure coding. I like to know how things work, how to break them, and then how to prevent them from being broken. I enjoy Binary Exploitation (I'm a psychopath) and Reverse Engineering, but you'll also find some web pentesting and other hacking write-ups here.

The purpose of this blog is to put my thoughts to paper, so to speak. I've come across multiple write-ups that don't properly explain what is going on and feels like the author just read another write-up and used that to solve the issue they are writing about. I'm going to do my best to explain my thought process and why certain steps need to be done in order to find the appropriate solution to what I'm writing about. This blog will also help me better understand what I'm working on because if I can explain it then I can, hopefully, understand it.

I don't do Bug Bounties and have no desire to do them.
